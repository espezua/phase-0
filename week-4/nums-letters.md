###What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal point like -20, 499, and 555.  A float is a number with decimal point like 1.0082, 2.2, and -34.579.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Integer divison will only give you integer answers and will round down the answer to be an integer, meaning it ditches everything after the decimal point.  For example, when dividing 11/2 you would get 5 rather than 5.5.  Where as float divison will return a specific answer with a decimal point, so dividing 5.0/2.0 will give you 2.5.
