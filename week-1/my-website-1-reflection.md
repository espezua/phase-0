###Describe what open source means.
Open source means you have access to the source code of a computer program.  Open source software can be freely used, modified, shared, and distributed by anyone.  Based on the license or licenses that were included in the open source software there are various requirements.



###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source benefits many people such as promoting collaboration, enabling people to learn from each other, and allowing customization. Open source doesn’t make me nervous or protective necessarily but it doesn’t feel like utopia.  There are some drawbacks to open source software like when proprietary software can provide better support or proprietary software works well with the hardware of your computer.



###Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because it can determine things such as whether software can be used commercially, what happens to derivatives, and if reciprocity is required.  Some open source licenses are Apache, Artistic License, FreeBSD, MIT License, Public Domain, Mozilla Public License, and GNU General Public License.  Each license determines what is required, permitted, and forbidden when using open source software.  When choosing a license or licenses for a piece of open source software you need to understand the requirements for each license and what works best for your situation to able to make an informed decision.



###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Some concepts that were solidified in this challenge were creating a repository, cloning a repository, and following the best practice way of making feature branches and pull requests.  In the previous challenge I had struggled with pull requests and had “aha” moment because of the practical experience this challenge gave me.



###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
This website, http://choosealicense.com/, helps you to choose an open source license based on your situation.  It also has a page, http://choosealicense.com/licenses/, which gives a general overview including bulleted lists of what is required, permitted, and forbidden for the featured open source licenses.  Some websites I found helpful for understanding the benefits and disadvantages of open source software were http://entrepreneurhandbook.co.uk/open-source-software/ , http://www.cio.com/article/2378859/open-source-tools/7-reasons-not-to-use-open-source-software.html, and http://www.pcworld.com/article/209891/10_reasons_open_source_is_good_for_business.html
