#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a two-dimensional mockup of the structure of a webpage including HTML elements like the header, body, and footer.  The wireframe is usually done in black and white so you can focus on the layout and hierarchy of information.  It can be created by drawing on paper, using sticky notes and markers on a whiteboard, or wireframing tools that allow you to design it in a file.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows a designer to focus on the design vs. content of their site and how a visitor will interact with the interface.  The designer can brainstorm ideas and make changes easily during this phase before any code is written.  Using the blueprint for their site a designer can start writing the code but still make changes to it later.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, I did enjoy wireframing my site.  I liked exploring other websites, using the extension from wirify, and tools like gliffy.com or cacoo.com to help me create my wireframes.  Next time though I’ll probably work on sketching before using a wireframing tool so I can quickly create several mockups and make adjustments.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised my wireframes several times by changing the structure and location of the elements I included in the header, body, and footer.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The questions I asked centered around what elements were usually included in the header, body, and footer as well as which wireframing tools were available.   I used http://wireframes.tumblr.com/ and wirify to get a visual understanding of how other designers wireframe.  Also, I explored the various tools listed in *A Beginner’s Guide to Wireframing*.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed the designing process and playing around with the layout of my webpages once I found a wireframing tool I wanted to use.  The tedious part for me was trying to find a wireframing tool that truly offered a free version to create wireframes.
