<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was fun and fairly easy.  Using the JSFiddle site was a little frustrating because everytime my partner typed in the text editor it would scroll back to the top and I couldn't see the progress we were making.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fairly easy to research and use semantic HTML5 elements because of the website HTML5 doctor gives examples and definitions for the elements.  As well, I used HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett during our pairing session to look up the structure for some of the elements.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
I think we did well at nesting elements within each other and using tags to separate the content based on the design.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The structure of HTML is pretty easy to understand because it is like the structure of a newspaper, magazine, etc.  As well, I like that you can render the code in a web browser to view how it will look.  The bad thing is that it can be tedious to type and fix, especially when you have webpage with a lot of HTML code.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I tend to visualize the structure of the page with the HTML tags and use hands-on practice to help me memorize the tags.  Also, I like to type the opening and closing tags for each element so I don't forget to close the HTML element.
