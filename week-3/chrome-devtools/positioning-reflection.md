##Positioning and Chrome's DevTools Reflection

###How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?


###How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
To resize elements on the DOM using CSS you need to create a CSS rule using a selector or selectors followed by a pair of curly braces. Inside the curly braces you make a declaration by using property-value pairs separating each declaration using a semicolon.
Some properties you can use to resize elements by setting a value are height, width, padding, margin, and border.

###What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
####Positioning

Absolute Positioning | Fixed Positioning | Static Positioning | Relative Positioning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*positions the element in relation to its closest positioned ancestor or containing element | *positions an element in relation to the browser window rather than the containing element |  *this is the default position for elements | *moves an element's position from its normal position or flow
*it will move along the page as a user scrolls if it has no positioned ancestors | *stays in the same place when the page is scrolled and doesn't affect the position of surrounding elements | *when the keyword 'static' is used it allows the element to use the normal behavior | *doesn't adjust the position of surrounding elements
*use top or bottom and left or right to specify where the element should appear | *use the top or bottom and right or left properties to position the element | *static positioned elements are not affected by the properties top, right, bottom, left, and z-index | *to shift a relatively-positioned element you set the top or bottom and right or left properties
