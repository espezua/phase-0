###What is your site’s primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site’s primary goal is to show I’m an aspiring web developer by presenting my work and skills to future employers.  The site’s content will feature information about me, my resume, a portfolio, a link to my blog, and my contact information.

###What is your target audience’s interest(s) and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience’s main interest is in finding a web developer that can bring value to their company.  My site will address that by show casing my work and skills through a portfolio, resume, and blog.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The user should take action by navigating quickly and easily to view information about my work and me with contact information available on each page in addition to a separate contact page.

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
When designing a website that most important phases are information gathering and planning.  It’s essential that you understand your target audience to create a website that is accessible, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. If the website isn’t easy to navigate your visitor/customer is most likely lost because it caused an unpleasant user experience.

###What is user experience design and why is it important?
The user experience design is about how a person feels when interacting with a system’s interface.   The user experience design considers usability, design, accessibility, marketing, system performance, ergonomics, human-computer interaction, utility, and human factors to optimize the user’s perception of a site.   As websites and apps have become more complex it’s important to use UX design to help create a positive user experience since it determines whether the user stays or returns.

###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The part I found tedious is that I’m not able to preview how the reflection is formatted with markdown in the webpage before pushing my changes to GitHub.
